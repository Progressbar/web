                    Girlfriend</strong><br />
            The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of
            Web attacks in order to meet your girlfriend. This
            includes entertaining and newly discovered attacks
            including PHP session prediction and random numbers
            (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser
            protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP
            server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript
            (turning your router against you), extracting extremely
            accurate geolocation information from a Web browser (not
            using IP geolocation), and more.
